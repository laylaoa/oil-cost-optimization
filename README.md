Cost optimization analysis of Alberta oil facilities using production data and Python
# Cost Optimization Analysis – Alberta Oil Facilities

# Overview
This project analyzes Alberta oil production data to identify key operating cost drivers and recommend cost optimization strategies.

# Data
- Alberta Petrinex production data (January 2025)
- Synthetic operating cost assumptions aligned with industry patterns

# Methods
- Data cleaning and aggregation
- Cost per bbl normalization
- Correlation analysis
- Production volume segmentation

# Key Insights
- Strong economies of scale
- Power costs are the most impactful controllable cost driver
- Maintenance optimization is more effective than labour cost reduction

# Tools
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
